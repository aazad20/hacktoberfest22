# In this notebook I have done :
1. Data Preprocessing 
2. Used Regression Algorithms for predictions
3. Used Deep Neural Network for prediction 

## Conclusion : Deep Neural Network performed best in this case with R2 Score of 0.99 and RMSE of 54 which is great considering the range of output variable.
